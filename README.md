## Problem Statment

Are you unsure of how many food delivery orders you have racked up? Do you want to see where and what you have ordered? 
**Where's my food?** is an Open API that keeps track of your past food delivery orders by displaying the order information of each delivery.

Feel free to check you food delivery orders via the **web application, CLI**, or both!

## Open Source Projects Used
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) was used as the web framework in this project.
- [Click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) was used as the command line interface creation kit.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) was used for rendering templates for the web app.


## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine.

### Installing

Even though this is a simple repo, there are three completely different projects in each folder.
For **each** of the folders `backend`, `frontend`, and `cli` you should run the following:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
